# Background

Arcanopoly is a variation on the classic friendship-testing board game Monopoly that adds 'Roguelike' elements! The game is fantasy-themed and players traverse a board filled with fantasy location names. Players can pick up cards and equipment that drastically alter the normal Monopoly game. Now you can ruin the family get together even worse than before!

# Functionality & MVPs

In a game of Arcanopoly, users will be able to:
* Select a token to use as a character sprite
* Roll dice to traverse a circular board full of properties
* Buy and sell properties, draw cards, and gain equipment (_very basic cards/equipment for the MVP_)
* Play cards on their turn to benefit themselves or hinder an opponent

The project will also include:
* An instructions tab that details the rules and interactions players can perform.
* A production README (_...eventually..._)

# Mockup

* Central game board with squares
* Dice rolling (not pictured) in the center of the board between decks
* Card decks and player's hand in the center
* List of players on the left, generated with JS
* Properties, game history, and "chat window" (_placeholder if multiplayer is not added_)

# Technologies, Libraries, APIs

Arcanopoly will be implemented with the following (_tentative_) technologies:
* Webpack and NPM for project bundling and running.
* Matter.js for object physics simulation
* (_BONUS GOAL_) Colyseus.io for multiplayer game hosting with Node.js.
